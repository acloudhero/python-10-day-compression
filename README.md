# Python 10-Day Compression Sprint

## Overview
This repository documents a 10-day Python compression sprint focused on building practical fluency as quickly as possible.

The goal is not academic mastery, but functional competence — writing, running, and iterating on Python scripts that mirror real-world usage in automation, cloud, and systems contexts.

## Objectives
- Become dangerous fast with Python
- Prepare for and pass the PCEP certification
- Build a public, timestamped trail of executable artifacts

## Structure
Each day contains a dedicated folder with one or more executable scripts covering a focused set of concepts.

## Progress Log
- **Day 1:** Python runtime, types, and basic arithmetic  
- **Day 2:** Control flow and explicit decision boundaries
- **Day 3:** Loops and iteration boundaries
- ## Day 4 – Functions and Reuse
- Defined reusable functions with parameters
- Used return values to pass data back to the program
- Combined functions with conditional logic

## Notes
- All scripts are intended to be run directly via the command line
- Commits are incremental and chronological to reflect learning progression
- This repo favors clarity and execution over abstraction
